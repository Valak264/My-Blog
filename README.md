# "My Blog" Content Management Service

A simple CMS built with Codeigniter 4, with Codeigniter Shield authentication 
plugin. I created this CMS to explore and learn about building website using 
this framework. 

Features of this project including :
- Login
- Register
- And create a new article using a registered user account

This project still requires improvements in terms of UI and features.
Upcoming features that will be added in future development including :
- Edit and delete post(s)
- Profile page
- Image insert
- etc.
